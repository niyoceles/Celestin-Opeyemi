      <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language.
        Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its
        environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>

      <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language
        elements such as operators, control structures, and statements.</p>

      <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
        greetMe("World")</code>

      <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>

      <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes,
        and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do
        not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>

        <h3>JavaScript and Java</h3>
      </header>

      <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript
        language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most
        Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was
        renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
      <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
  greetMe("World");</code>
      <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime
        system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a
        prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model
        provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also
        supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects,
        executing as loosely typed methods.</p>

        <h3>Hello World</h3>
      </header>

      <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
      </p>

      <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
      <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
        greetMe("World");</code>

    <section class="main-section" id="variables">
      <header>
        <h3> Variables</h3>
      </header>
      <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers,
        conform to certain rules.</p>

      <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can
        also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z"
        (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
      <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
        greetMe("World");</code>

      <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
          greetMe("World");</code>
